// Replace this file with custom middleware functions, including authentication and rate limiting

// middleware = functions/code that run *before* your route runs.
// A request comes in -> middleware does something -> your route runs -> a response is sent back.
// Think of middleware like checkpoints..

/* ASK:  What are the best things to put in a authMiddleware by convention?
e.g. data validation , password salting, checking if username exists, etc. */
